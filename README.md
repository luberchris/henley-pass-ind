# HENLEY PASSPORT INDEX SUMMARY
## Chris Luber, 13 July, 2023
### Project Purpose
The data for Makeover Monday's 10 July, 2023 data set outlined strength of passports based on the number of countries each allows its holders to enter without a passport.

### Data Review
Each row is separated by year, rank, country, and total visa-free destinations. During this project, different calculations through DAX were used to generate specific visual strings, values, percentages, and differences.

Data provided by Henley & Partners.

### Insights

* When broken out into "buckets" of 50 countries accessible without a visa per passport, Central, Northern, and Western European countries made up a majority of the highest quartile bucket, while 3 of the top 5 strongest passports are from Southeastern and Eastern Asia.
* Conversely, Southwest Asian and East African passports made up a majority of the lowest quartile bucket, while the UAE, Israel, and Seychelles passports stand out as more powerful than their neighbors.
* The largest concentration of total visa-free destinations by passport were 52 countries accessible and 188 countries accessible.
* Two valuable overlays for this dataset would be GDP and political ties. Henley & Partners cites that "[countries] that have higher gross domestic product (GDP) per capita  according to World Bank data also enjoy more visa-free destinations."
* With politics playing a heavy role in the strength of passports, Henly & Partners also cites what is known as 'fragility.' "One of the primary indicators [of fragility] is the level of violence in a country,  measured by bombings, terrorist attacks, ethnic conflict, and organized crime."
* Lastly, Henley & Parnters cites the University of Gothernburg, arguing that "the form of government does not have as strong a correlation with passport strength as other factors," such as fragility and GDP.
* On the whole, citizens with passports from wealthy, stable countries enjoy greater travel freedom overall.
